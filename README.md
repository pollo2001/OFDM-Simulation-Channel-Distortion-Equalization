### Section A: OFDM Symbols & Guard Intervals

- 🎯 Purpose: Create 128-point OFDM symbols with 32-sample guard intervals.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Random QPSK-like symbols mapped into frequency bins.
    - IFFT to generate time-domain OFDM signals.
    - Zero-padding and cyclic prefix prepended for ISI mitigation.

### Section B: FFT Transform Segments

- 🎯 Purpose: Analyze individual OFDM symbol frequency content.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Take FFT of time-domain symbols ignoring guard interval.
    - Plot real/imag components and scatter to visualize spectral distribution.

**DSP Concepts:** Symbol-wise FFT, frequency-domain inspection.
"""

# %% === 3️⃣ Channel Distortion Simulation ===
"""
### Section C: Channel Effects

- 🎯 Purpose: Model multipath or linear channel distortions.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Convolution with complex channel impulse response.
    - Observe frequency-domain impact on transmitted symbols.

### Section D: Cyclic Prefix Handling

- 🎯 Purpose: Preserve OFDM orthogonality under multipath channel.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Insert cyclic prefix before channel.
    - Compare FFT segments with and without CP.

**DSP Concepts:** Cyclic prefix, ISI mitigation, symbol recovery.
"""

# %% === 5️⃣ Preamble & Channel Estimation ===
"""
### Section E: Preamble & Channel Estimation

- 🎯 Purpose: Estimate channel response using known preamble.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - FFT of preamble and received signal.
    - Divide received by transmitted preamble for channel estimate.
    - Zero out edge bins to remove noise.

**DSP Concepts:** Channel estimation, frequency-domain equalization.

"""
# 🌟 OFDM Equalization & Preamble Detection

This script explains Sections F & G from the MATLAB OFDM project:

- Section F: Extracts data portion after preamble, removes cyclic prefix, performs FFT and equalization, and visualizes constellations.
- Section G: Creates a special preamble, simulates signal rotation and delay, detects preamble with cross-correlation, and estimates rotation rate.
"""

# %% === 1️⃣ Section F: Equalizer & Data Extraction ===
"""
### Section F: Equalization & Data Extraction

- 🎯 Purpose: Extract data symbols after preamble, remove cyclic prefix, apply FFT, and equalize using estimated channel response.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - `data_start` identifies the first sample of actual data after preambles.
    - Reshape received samples into symbols, removing the cyclic prefix.
    - FFT of each symbol is divided by preamble-based channel estimate `H_est`.
    - Only active data carriers are extracted and plotted.

**DSP Concepts:** Cyclic prefix removal, FFT-based equalization, data carrier extraction, constellation visualization.
"""

# %% === 2️⃣ Section G: Special Preamble & Rotation Estimation ===
"""
### Section G: Special Preamble & Rotation Estimation

- 🎯 Purpose: Create known frequency-domain preamble, simulate signal rotation and noise, detect preamble, and estimate phase rotation.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - `special_bins` defines only certain active subcarriers in preamble.
    - IFFT generates time-domain preamble.
    - Test signal concatenates zero-padding, preamble, and OFDM symbols; noise and rotation are added.
    - Cross-correlation between received signal and preamble identifies start of preamble.
    - Phase rotation is estimated via recursive smoothing of angles.
    - Visualizations show cross-correlation, auto-correlation, ratio, and estimated rotation rate.

**DSP Concepts:** Frequency-domain preamble, cross-correlation detection, phase rotation estimation, preamble synchronization.
"""

# %% === Notes 📝
"""
- Guard intervals prevent ISI; cyclic prefix preserves orthogonality.
- FFT segments visualize frequency bins of each OFDM symbol.
- Convolution simulates channel distortion; equalization corrects it.
- Constellation plots validate symbol recovery visually.
