# OFDM-Simulation-Channel-Distortion-Equalization
This project simulates 128-point OFDM symbols with cyclic prefixes, guard intervals, and channel distortion, analyzing their time-domain and frequency-domain behavior. It implements FFT-based visualization, channel estimation, and equalization to observe the effects on symbol constellations and frequency spectra.
