# 🌐 OFDM Simulation, Channel Distortion & Equalization

This script explains the MATLAB OFDM pipeline, including:
- Symbol generation with guard intervals & cyclic prefixes
- FFT-based visualization of segments
- Channel effects, convolution, and equalization
- Constellation analysis pre- and post-equalization
"""

# %% === 1️⃣ OFDM Symbol Generation & Guard Interval ===
"""
### Section A: OFDM Symbols & Guard Intervals

- 🎯 Purpose: Create 128-point OFDM symbols with 32-sample guard intervals.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Random QPSK-like symbols mapped into frequency bins.
    - IFFT to generate time-domain OFDM signals.
    - Zero-padding and cyclic prefix prepended for ISI mitigation.

**DSP Concepts:** OFDM modulation, guard intervals, cyclic prefix.
"""

# %% === 2️⃣ FFT Transform Segments ===
"""
### Section B: FFT Transform Segments

- 🎯 Purpose: Analyze individual OFDM symbol frequency content.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Take FFT of time-domain symbols ignoring guard interval.
    - Plot real/imag components and scatter to visualize spectral distribution.

**DSP Concepts:** Symbol-wise FFT, frequency-domain inspection.
"""

# %% === 3️⃣ Channel Distortion Simulation ===
"""
### Section C: Channel Effects

- 🎯 Purpose: Model multipath or linear channel distortions.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Convolution with complex channel impulse response.
    - Observe frequency-domain impact on transmitted symbols.

**DSP Concepts:** Linear convolution, channel modeling, frequency response.
"""

# %% === 4️⃣ Cyclic Prefix Processing ===
"""
### Section D: Cyclic Prefix Handling

- 🎯 Purpose: Preserve OFDM orthogonality under multipath channel.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Insert cyclic prefix before channel.
    - Compare FFT segments with and without CP.

**DSP Concepts:** Cyclic prefix, ISI mitigation, symbol recovery.
"""

# %% === 5️⃣ Preamble & Channel Estimation ===
"""
### Section E: Preamble & Channel Estimation

- 🎯 Purpose: Estimate channel response using known preamble.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - FFT of preamble and received signal.
    - Divide received by transmitted preamble for channel estimate.
    - Zero out edge bins to remove noise.

**DSP Concepts:** Channel estimation, frequency-domain equalization.
"""

# %% === 6️⃣ Equalization & Constellation Analysis ===
"""
### Section F: Equalization & Constellation Visualization

- 🎯 Purpose: Compensate channel effects and recover transmitted symbols.
- 🔧 Code Choices:
    - Divide received FFT bins by channel estimate.
    - Plot real, imaginary, and 2D constellations pre- and post-equalization.

**DSP Concepts:** Frequency-domain equalization, constellation analysis, symbol recovery.
"""

# %% === Notes 📝
"""
- Guard intervals prevent ISI; cyclic prefix preserves orthogonality.
- FFT segments visualize frequency bins of each OFDM symbol.
- Convolution simulates channel distortion; equalization corrects it.
- Constellation plots validate symbol recovery visually.
